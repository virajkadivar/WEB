Q.How do you create a list without bullets in CSS?
To create a list without bullets in CSS, you need to target the list element(s) and set the list-style-type property to none. Typically, you will either work with unordered lists (< ul >) or ordered lists (< ol >). Here's how you can remove bullets (or numbers) from an unordered list:

ul {
  list-style-type: none;
}
This CSS rule targets all unordered lists (< ul >) in the document and removes the bullets by setting the list-style-type to none.

Q.Can we add an image as a list item marker?
To add an image as the list-item marker in a list, we use the list-style-image property in CSS. 

Syntax:

list-style-image: none | url | initial | inherit;
