Q.What is the difference between CSS border and outline?
CSS border properties allow us to set the style, color, and width of the border.
CSS outline property allows us to draw a line around the element, outside the border.
Example:


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <style>      
        p {
            outline: 5px solid #ddd;
            border: 1px solid #000;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>

</html> 
Differences:

Unlike borders, outlines donâ€™t allow us to set each edge to a different width, or set different colors and styles for each edge. An outline is the same on all sides.
Outlines cannot be circular.
Outlines do not take up space, because they are always placed on top of the box of the element.
