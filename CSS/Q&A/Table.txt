Q.How do you create a CSS-only sticky table header that remains visible during vertical scrolling?
To create a CSS-only sticky table header, you can use the CSS position: sticky property along with appropriate styles. Here's an example:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Header 1</th>
      <th>Header 2</th>
      <th>Header 3</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <!-- table rows -->
  </tbody>
</table>
cssCopy code
thead th {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background-color: #fff;
}
In this example, the table header (< thead >) is set to position: sticky with top: 0 to keep it fixed at the top of the table. The background-color property can be used to style the sticky header.
