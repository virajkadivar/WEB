    <h1 style="text-align: center;">HTML Comments</h1>

    <li>HTML comments are ignored by browsers if we comment in HTML code then codes are more readable to us. </li>

    <h2>What are HTML Comments?</h2>
    <li>HTML comments are annotations or notes added in an HTML code that are not displayed by the browser.</li>
    <li>Just like comments in other languages HTML comments also serve the same purpose of providing code explanations, reminders, or instructions for developers who are collaborating on the same project.</li>

    <h2>Ways to Comment in HTML</h2>
    <li>There are two ways to comment in HTML.</li> <br>
    <li>Single-line Comment: The single-line comment is given inside the ( &lt;!-  comment -&gt; ) tag. </li>
    <li>Syntax: &lt;!-  comment -&gt; </li>
    <br>
    <li>Multi-line Comment: It follows the syntax of a single-line comment by adding multiple lines in the comment. </li>
    <li>Syntax: &lt;!- Multi Line Comment -&gt;</li>
    <br>

    
    <li><strong> Note </strong>: The shortcut for adding the comment through the keyboard is by typing <b>Ctrl + / in Windows, and Command + / for Mac users</b>.</li>
