    <h1 style="text-align: center;">HTML File Paths</h1>
    <li>HTML file paths specify the location of HTML files within a directory structure.</li>
    <li>They can be absolute (starting from the root directory) or relative (starting from the current directory),
        facilitating file organization and linking.</li>
    <li>To insert a file in a web page, its source must be known. For example, the syntax (&lt;img src=” ” alt=” “&gt;)
        is
        used to insert an image file, where the path of the file is mentioned in the source (src). </li>

    <h3>Examples of File Path</h3>

            <td>&lt;img src="../pc_img.png"&gt;</td>
            <td>When the file is located in the folder that is one level up from the current directory.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;img src="/pics/pc_img.png"&gt;</td>
            <td>When the files are in the folder &amp; it is located at the root of the current directory.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;img src="pics/pc_img.png"&gt;</td>
            <td>The files are located inside the folder in the current working directory.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;img src="pc_img.png"&gt;</td>
            <td>When the files are located in the current working directory.</td>

    <h3>HTML File Paths Examples</h3>
    File paths are of two types:
    <li>Absolute File Paths</li>
    <li>Relative File Paths</li>


    <h4>Absolute File Paths</h4>
    <li>Absolute file paths specify the complete location of a file in a system, starting from the root directory.  </li>
    <li>They include the full directory path, ensuring precise file identification regardless of current directory location. </li>
   
    <li><strong>Syntax:</strong></li><br>
    <li>&lt;img src="https://media.viraj.org/wp-content/uploads/pc.png" alt="My Image"&gt;</li>

    <h4>Relative File Path</h4>
    <li>A relative file path in HTML refers to the location of a file relative to the current web page's location.</li>
    <li><strong>Syntax:</strong></li><br>
    <li>&lt;img src="/images/pc.jpg" alt="My Image"&gt;</li>
