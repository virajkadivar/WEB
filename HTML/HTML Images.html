    <h1 style="text-align: center;">HTML Images</h1>
    <li>how to add the image in HTML, along with knowing its implementation & usage through the examples.</li>
    <li>In earlier times, the web pages only contains textual contents, which made them appear quite boring and
        uninteresting. </li>

    <br>
    <li>There are 2 ways to insert the images into a webpage:</li>
    <li>By providing a full path or address (URL) to access an internet file.</li>
    <li>By providing the file path relative to the location of the current web page file.</li>

    <br>
    <h5>Adding images on a webpage:</h5>
    <li>The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to add or embed the images to a webpage/website.</li>
    <li> The “img” tag is an empty tag, which means it can contain only a list of attributes and it has no closing tag.
    </li>
    <li>The addition of the images improves the quality along with enhancing the design structure, appearance of the
        webpage.</li>
    <li>A website does not directly add images to a web page, as the images are linked to web pages by using the
        &lt;img&gt; tag which holds space for the image. </li>

    <br>
    <strong>Syntax:</strong><br>
    <li>&lt;img src="url" alt="some_text" width="" height=""&gt;</li>

    <br>
    <strong>Attribute: </strong> The &lt;img&gt; tag has following attributes:
    <br>
    <br>
    <li><strong>src:</strong> It is used to specify the path to the image.</li>
    <li><strong>alt:</strong> It is used to specify an alternate text for the image. It is useful as it informs the user
        about what the image
        means and also due to any network issue if the image cannot be displayed then this alternate text will be
        displayed.</li>
    <li><strong>crossorigin:</strong> It is used to import images from third-party sites that allow cross-origin access
        to be used with
        canvas.</li>
    <li><strong>height:</strong> It is used to specify the height of the image.</li>
    <li><strong>width:</strong> It is used to specify the width of the image.</li>
    <li><strong>ismap:</strong> It is used to specify an image as a server-side image map.</li>
    <li><strong>loading:</strong> It is used to specify whether a browser should defer the loading of images until some
        conditions are met or
        load an image immediately.</li>
    <li><strong>longdesc:</strong> It is used to specify a URL to a detailed description of an image.</li>
    <li><strong>referrerpolicy:</strong> It is used to specify which referrer information to use when fetching an image
        i.e. no-referrer,
        no-referrer-when-downgrade, origin, origin-when-cross-origin, unsafe-url.</li>
    <li><strong>sizes:</strong> It is used to specify image sizes for different page layouts.</li>
    <li><strong>srcset:</strong> It is used to specify a list of image files to use in different situations.</li>
    <li><strong>usemap:</strong> It is used to specify an image as a client-side image map.</li>


    <h3>src: </h3>
    <li>The src stands for source.</li>
    <li>Every image has an src attribute which tells the browser where to find the image you want to display.</li>
    <li>The URL of the image provided points to the location where the image is stored. </li>
    <li>When the webpage loads for the first time, then the browser gets the image from a web server and inserts it into
        the page.</li>
    <li>If the image is not spotted by the browser then users will get a broken link icon. </li>
    <li>It might be possible if the file path is wrong or the image got deleted from that location.</li>

    <h3>alt: </h3>
    <li>If the image cannot be displayed then the alt attribute acts as an alternative description for the image.</li>
    <li>The value of the alt attribute is a user-defined text. </li>
    <li> It generally happens when the user, for some reason, cannot view it due to a slow internet connection or an
        error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.</li>

    <h3>Setting width and height of Image: </h3>
    <li>The width and height attributes are used to specify the height and width of an image.</li>
    <li>The attribute values are specified in pixels by default. </li>
    <li> The width and height attributes are always declared in pixels. </li>

    <h3>Adding titles to Image: </h3>
    <li>Along with the images, titles can also be added to images to provide further information related to the inserted
        image.</li>
    <li>For inserting a title, the title attribute is used.</li>

    <h3>Setting style to the Image:</h3>
    <li>using the border property to decorate the image.</li>
    <li>By default, every picture has a border around it.</li>
    <li>By using the border attribute, the thickness of the border can be changed.</li>
    <li> A thickness of “0” means that there will be no border around the picture.</li>

    <h3>Aligning an Image: </h3>
    <li>By default, an image is aligned on the left side of the page, but it can be aligned to the centre or right using
        the align attribute.</li>

    <h3>Adding Image as a Link:</h3>
    <li>An image can work as a link with a URL embedded in it. It can be done by using the “img” tag inside an “a” tag.
    </li>
    <li>need to specify the file path in order to render the image on the webpage.</li>
    <li>File paths are used to link external resources such as images, videos, style sheets, JavaScript, displaying
        other web pages, etc.</li>
    <li> To insert a file on a web page its source must be known.</li>

    <h4>File paths are of two types:</h4>
    <li><strong>Absolute File Paths:</strong>It always contains the root element along with the complete directory list
        required to locate the file.</li>
    <li><strong>Relative File Paths:</strong>It is the hierarchical path representation that locates the file or folder
        on a file system beginning from the current directory.</li>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h4><strong>Adding animated Image:</strong>Animated images in .gif format can also be added using the “img” tag.
