What are HTML tags ?
HTML tags are the keywords that are used to produce web pages in various formats. 
Opening tags and closing tags are found in the majority of tags. 
The concluding tags contain a forward slash (/), while the language of the beginning tags is the same. 
Certain tags donâ€™t need to be closed.
